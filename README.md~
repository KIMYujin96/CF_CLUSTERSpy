###### Description
  
CF_CLUSTSERSpy is a code, designed for comparing structures of moleclues or clusters.

There are two different types of Python written sources, "CF_CLUSTERSpy_MAIN.py" and "CF_CLUSTERSpy_MOD.py".

"CF_CLUSTERSpy_MOD.py" is the source, which contains the methods used in "CF_CLUSTERSpy_MAIN.py".

"CF_CLUSTERSpy_MAIN.py" is the main executable that writes the output of the user requested work.

For instance, to execute the code user can type the following command line,

(***Before trying the following command lines, make sure that you have Python version above 3 and Numpy package is installed***)

$ python CF_CLUSTERSpy_MAIN.py   /path/to/1st/input/file   /path/to/2nd/input/file

In the above command line, you can find that the code requires two arguments, which are files (or their paths) including structural data of molecules or clusters, user wants to compare.

***The format of input files must be "~.xyz", which are generally used in many different structural visualisation packages, e.g., VESTA,
and the atoms/ions in those two different xyz files must be in the same order***

Once you successfully finshed cloning the repository, you can find two different sample input files, '1_AIMS_N6.xyz' and '1_SLAM_N6.xyz',
which are structural data of (SnO)N clusters with size of N=6 calculated by using DFT (density functional theory) and SLAM force field, respectively.

To compare those two different structures, one might try the following command line,

$ python CF_CLUSTERSpy_MAIN.py 1_AIMS_N6.xyz 1_SLAM_N6.xyz 

Afterwards there will be four new files generated in the same directory, which are 

1. CF.out      : main output file including general overview of structural anaylsis.

2. CF_1.xyz    : rotated / recentred structural data (in xyz format) of the first input file (for this case '1_AIMS_N6.xyz').

3. CF_2.xyz    : rotated / recentred structural data (in xyz format) of the second input file (for this case '1_SLAM_N6.xyz').

4. CF_3.xyz    : plot of both 'CF_1.xyz' and 'CF_2.xyz' in the same xyz file for visual comparison.
